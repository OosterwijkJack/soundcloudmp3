How to use:

Place links to SoundCloud song into songLinks.txt (don't use the copy link button SoundCloud has copy straight from the search bar), make sure there are no spaces or empty lines
Run main.py
Songs will be downloaded to songs dir, i would check to make sure each song is the right one beacause for some reason the soundcloud to mp3 site I used can throw a random song back. 

How it works:

It simply just makes requests to a website that already converts soundcloud to mp3 but it is much faster.
This is only useful when you have multiple song and want to download them all at once.
I made it because I use imported files to Apple Music a lot and was going through the slow manual process.
