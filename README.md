How to use:

Place links to soundcloud into songLinks.txt, make sure there are no spaces or empy lines
Run main.py
Songs will be downloaded to songs dir, i would check to make sure each song is the right one beacause for some reason the soundcloud to mp3 site I used can throw a random song back. 

How it works:

It simply just makes requests to a website that already converty soundcloud to mp3 but it is much faster.
This is only usefull when you have multiple song and want to download them all at once.
I made it becase I use imported files on apply music a lot and was going through the slow manual process.
